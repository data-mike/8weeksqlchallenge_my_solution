# 8weeksqlchallenge_my_solution
This Repository contains my solution to the different case studies from 8weeksqlchallenge.com.
The 8weeksqlchallenge is a collection of different "business question" case studies and how to use sql to leverage data held in databases to answer these questions. 
Additionally, this repository also doubles as a guide to anyone trying to navigate the interesting world of sql.
Note: The sql solutions contained in this repository are based on mysql DBMS.
